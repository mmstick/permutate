Forked to further generalize the list wrapper (can i haz tuples).  
Most features and (all) documentation, and also the binary, had to be temporarily removed because I intend to use the tuple feature asap.  
I'll try to catch up with other features, doc and the bin, so I won't upload this fork to crates.io. If you happen to catch it, please ping me :)

```bash
$ cargo run --example overview
```

Please see the original upstream for more information.
